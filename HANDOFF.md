# Aegis handoff

## Objective

Bootstrap Aegis as a greenfield Repository Operating System pilot.

## Current state

- ROS 3.0.0 greenfield profile installed on 2026-09-16.
- Project charter is a draft.
- No first vertical slice, evidence record, hypothesis, or experiment has been
  accepted.
- The operating system is under evaluation.

## Validation

Run:

```bash
./ros registry check
./ros validate
```

## Unresolved questions

1. What concrete communication problem and user should the first slice serve?
2. What baseline workflow will be used for comparison?
3. What data, privacy, safety, and accessibility constraints apply?
4. Which outcome would distinguish useful engineering from additional process?

## Next action

Complete `PROJECT-CHARTER.md`, choose the first bounded outcome, and record its
baseline and acceptance criteria in `context/CURRENT-STATE.md`.
